*Â From Windows10 side:

  Unable to negotiate with 192.168.1.31 port 22: no matching key exchange method found. Their offer: diffie-hellman-group1-sha1

* From switch side:

:bulb: edit:

Seems Windows 10 in-built ssh has turned off by default several older (less secure) ciphers. Still, if you need them, you can enable them:

```
$ ssh -oKexAlgorithms=+diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 -c aes256-cbc 192.168.1.31
```

  -c cipher_spec
               Selects the cipher specification for encrypting the session.
               cipher_spec is a comma-separated list of ciphers listed in order of
               preference.  See the Ciphers keyword in ssh_config(5) for more infor-
               mation.
